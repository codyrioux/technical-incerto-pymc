# Technical Incerto PyMC

An implementation of Nassim Taleb's Technical Incerto as a series of Jupyter notebooks but focusing on using PyMC and PyTensor as the underlying framework. I'm intending to achieve three things in order of priority:

1. Crystalize my understanding of the contents of the Technical Incerto.
2. Improve my proficiency with using PyMC for data analysis.
3. Contribute something that has yet to be contributed in the space of Technical Incerto implementations.
